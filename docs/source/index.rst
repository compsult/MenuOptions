Welcome to MenuOptions
=====================================================

MenuOptions is a jQuery widget designed to optimize the speed of data entry
for both mouse and keyboard users.
It has:

- a select control that enables 1 click data entry

- intelligent autocomplete that automatically removes invalid characters and 
  can utilize multicolumn select lists.

- like the select element, MenuOptions uses visible labels and hidden values

- menus built from JSON that follow URLs or execute javascript functions and allow dividers

- mouseover filtering that allows users to see a subset of choices just by 
  passing the mouse over a filter.

- a clear button that wipes the current value and opens the select list
  (most useful in FireFox).

- the ability to be dynamically reloaded with new values (without destroying & recreating).

- an onSelect option that returns the selected value and it's hidden value

- has a rocker control for binary choices (yes/no, true/false, etc)

- is flexible, configurable and stays in the viewport

- been tested on Win 8.1 IE10 and Safari 5.17, on Ubuntu Chrome 41.0.2272 and Firefox 37.0

- has a suite of 14 automated tests
