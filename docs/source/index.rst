Welcome to MenuOptions
=====================================================

MenuOptions is a jQuery widget designed to optimize the speed of data entry
for both mouse and keyboard users.
MenuOptions can create menus and select lists which:

- have divider headings to break the menu or select list down into subsections. 

- have mouseover filtering that allows users to see a subset of the menu just by 
  passing the mouse over a filter.

- has autocomplete functionality as part of its select list control.

- can be dynamically reloaded with new values (without destroying & recreating).

- has an option to trigger an event upon user selection (useful when resetting
  other parts of the page based on user selection).

Prerequisites:
--------------

- jQuery version >=1.9
- jQuery ui version >= 1.10
- download `MenuOptions <https://github.com/compsult/MenuOptions>`_
